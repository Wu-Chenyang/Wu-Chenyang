## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Artificial Intelligence of Nanjing University. I'm privileged to be part of the esteemed LAMDA Group where I work under the insightful guidance of Associate Prof. Zongzhang Zhang.

In June 2023, I was honored with the "Outstanding Graduate" award as I earned my M.Sc. degree from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Nanjing University. My time with Associate Prof. Zhang has allowed me to deeply delve into the complexities of decision making under uncertainty. This rewarding research phase not only honed my skills in artificial intelligence but also set the stage for my ambitious doctoral pursuits.

My academic journey began at the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of Southeast University, where I earned a B.Eng. degree in June 2019. It was during these transformative undergraduate years that I grappled with profound personal challenges, which led me to introspect deeply about the nature of self and the essence of intelligence. This introspection, born out of a period of depression and self-reflection, eventually ignited my passion for artificial intelligence. The quest to understand myself evolved into a broader ambition to decode the intricacies of intelligence, which now remains central to my research.

Currently, I am working on unraveling the secrete of intelligence and building an intelligent agent. Specifically, I focus on three research problems that I believe to be fundamental to the intelligence:
- Online learning from non-IID data streams
- Efficient reasoning with limited resources
- Balancing between exploration and exploitation
